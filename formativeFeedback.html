            In order to properly run the usability tests provided by the Wakr group, the test plan was used as well as the pre/post-posttest questionnaires. The results and observations of the tests can be seen in the document below.

            For practical reasons, the chosen test subjects corresponded to the student persona criteria. Note that subject #2 was a student AND office worker. All three subjects were found randomly and tested in Trottier building using the app downloaded from the notebook page. Two out of three participants showed obvious experience with Android devices while one of them seemed to be more hesitant during the navigation to start the Wakr mobile application (subject #1).

            <h3>Subject comments and examiner observations</h3>

            <p>Subject #1 found it strange to be asked to select a wearable device while he was wearing no device for testing. However, it was explained to him after the experiment that the system will be using a wearable head mounted device.</p>
            <p>The user did not know what a “persona” was and was confused when encountering this term in the requested task and application. Furthermore, since the notion of personas was foreign to him, he had no ideas what “customizing a personas” was. He just opened all of the possible personas and checked boxes randomly in each personas parameter section. Consequently, he did not totally understand how to verify if the modifications were saved but he eventually left and reopened the personas settings and saw that they were still there. It seems like he did not notice the “toast” message displaying that the modifications were saved.</p>
            <p>He also found it challenging to use the app and took a considerable amount of time to complete relatively simple tasks. However, that may be due to the fact that subject #1 was not an everyday Android user like subject #2 and 3.</p>
            <p>When asked to locate his “Statistics”, he struggled to locate them in any of the submenus. A comment was made that it isn’t completely obvious where to find the user “Statistics” if it is located under the “History” submenu. He also commented on the user manual button inside the app not opening the user manual which he would have expected to happen.</p>
            <p>The user thought that having to start the timer and stopping every 15 seconds was a tedious task. He  told that he knew since first time (after 15 seconds) that he was able to start and stop it because of how simple the interface is for this function</p>

            <h3>Subject comments and examiner observations</h3>
            <p>Test subject #3 was not told before the experiment that a wearable device would be normally used with the application.</p>
            <p>This user was able to complete all of the tasks fairly quickly. She made a comment that the application UI would look nicer with “a design or a theme” even though this is not relevant for the usability analysis. When asked what the app is used for, she thought that it was a “timer of some sort”. As an examiner, NavSense group felt like having a proper user introduction would have helped in regards to that.</p>

            <h2>Heuristic Evaluation</h2>

            <p><em><b>1.	When using wakr, did you find the interface clear and easy to understand?</b></em></p>

            <p>Since we are a project team composed of engineers, we did not find the Wakr interface complicated in the slightest. The interface was very minimalist and did not have too much margin for error. We found that one thing which wasn’t clear was why the statistics are hidden under the “history” menu. Another issue was that “personas” isn’t a very good submenu name if you expect non-HCI students to use this application. Although certain things were not very clear, the application was generally well received and easy to understand nonetheless.</p>

            <p><b><em>2.	How efficient did you find wakr in achieving its purpose?</em></b></p>

            <p>Since we did not have a completed prototype to test, we could not fully judge how well Wakr was able to achieve its purpose. Ideally we would have had the Wakr peripheral rather than just a basic application to base our conclusions on. From what we experienced with the app however, it wasn’t immediately clear what the purpose was. Since it only consisted of a very basic timer, it didn’t really didn’t demonstrate much functionality other than how the UI navigation worked.</p>
            <p><em><b>3.	Did you feel confident that your actions in wakr were completed (i.e clicking a button results in an action)?</em></b></p>

            <p>The UI buttons in the Wakr application had very good visual feedback. When clicking the timer start button (Which takes up the majority of the page), it changes from blue to red to indicate that it is currently on. In personas submenu, the radio buttons and fields all had visual feedback to notify the user of a resulting change. However certain sections of the application of course had no feedback at all because they were incomplete. The “User Manual” button doesn’t do anything, along with a handful of other options. This is understandable however because the application isn’t expected to be fully completed at this time.</p>
            <p><em><b>4.	Did you find naming conventions across wakr consistent? Were they, in general, familiar to you?</em></b></p>

            <p>The naming conventions across Wakr were consistent. Since we are experienced with technical terms and HCI terms, we found that at no point were we confused about naming conventions. However as mentioned previously, had we not been HCI students we would not know what “personas” mean.</p>
            <p><em><b>5.	Did you find wakr to have a design that’s too minimalistic?</em></b></p>

            <p>The Wakr application design was not too minimalistic. Since it is prefered to navigate a clear and uncluttered UI, a minimalist approach is always appreciated. We did not find that the minimalism of the application was hindering its ability to convey information and/or additional features. The minimalism especially helps on the home page where the timer is located. The “Start”/”Pause” buttons are very large and take up 50% of the screen real-estate which is appropriate considering how much they will be used.</p>
            <p><em><b>6.	Did you ever find yourself stuck when using wakr? Was navigating the system clear?</em></b></p>

            <p>When navigating the Wakr system, we never found ourselves stuck. Although certain menus were non-functional, such as the “User Manual”, we were almost never in a situation where we couldn’t advance. There was only one issue in the “personas” editing menu where the only two button options were “next” or “save”. Although we were able to use the Android back button, it would have been more easy to navigate the system if it had a dedicated back button on this page.</p>

            <h1>Test Plan Critique</h1>
            <p>The following section presents a critique of the test plan and various components that were provided such as the pre-test questionnaire, post-test questionnaire and data collection sheet.</p>
            <h2>Tasks and associated criteria</h2>

            <p>In general, tasks proposed in the “laboratory experiment” of the usability evaluation were relevant in terms of their assumed association with usability criteria. However, in the Wakr computer prototype submission, no explicit reference to the rationale behind the tasks were presented. The next few paragraphs go over each of the tasks explaining how they are significant and how they relate to usability criteria.</p>
            <p><em><b>1.	Open wakr. Now, choose your device, ear-buddy, from a list of available devices.</em></b></p>

            <p>This task and time measure associated to it are related to the “ease of use” criteria. It is straightforward and there is really no way for the user to do it wrong since the window just pops up when the application is started and there is no way to avoid it. The 10 seconds maximum time objective was reasonable but one of the user failed to comply with this requirement. Reducing the number of choices for the user to pick from (ear-buddy, other device1, other device 2) would potentially have helped in reducing the time taken by the uncertain subject #1. These other choices are nonexistent anyway. Another approach would have been to emphasize on the visibility of the ear-buddy button.</p>

            <p><em><b>2.	Now that you’ve selected a device, choose a ‘persona’ to use when using wakr.</em></b></p>

            <p>Once the user figures out how to choose the ear-buddy device they have to select a persona. The only issue here is that most users don’t know what a ‘persona’ is. Although they can figure it out by seeing the button, it might have been more effective to ask the user to choose a ‘profile’ and rename the menu. This task was well done for participants 2 and 3. However participant #1 failed according to the provided criteria because he did not know what a persona was and could not figure it out nor ask questions. Related usability criteria would be ease of use and effectiveness. The pass time was set to 30 seconds which seems to be reasonable for the required task</p>
            <p><em><b>3.	Now that you’ve chosen a persona, customize the settings of that persona. Save your changes and verify that your changes were saved.</em></b></p>

            <p>This task is important because it reflects how the application gives feedback concerning its state. Other criterias would be ease of use (how easy is it to save changes and make sure they are saved) and effectiveness (Is it able to properly save the personal settings ?) Once the subjects found the personas, it seemed easy for them to reach for the customization menu thank to the “tool” button. They saved the settings but were not sure about the proper method to reach the previous menu level.</p>
            <p>A flaw in the testing procedure was that two pass/fail criteria were provided and did not correspond to the same region nor value. One of the usability evaluation criteria said that the user had to do it in under 2 minutes (120 seconds) and the other in 20 seconds.</p>
            <p><em><b>4.	Now, find the wakr user manual from within the application. </em></b></p>

            <p>Test subjects did not have problems finding the user manual. The fact that they went directly to the settings menu to find it reflects their familiarity with mobile applications. This task also served to evaluate the general ease of use of the application.</p>
            <p><em><b>5.	Now, view your ‘statistics’ regarding wakr.</em></b></p>
            <p>Users #1 and 2 experienced issues with this task because of the formulation of the question. By phrasing it differently it would have been a lot easier to find the required information. An example of such a phrase would be “Now, view your usate HISTORY within the wakr app”. This confusion was due to an inconsistency in the vocabulary used in the question and inside the application. Also, no quantifiable pass/fail criteria were provided for this task.</p>

            <p><em><b>6.	Finally, start using wakr! ‘Track’ your activity for one minute, while pausing/starting the timer at 15 second intervals.</em></b></p>

            <p>This task, without the wearable device, can be confusing to the user but it reflects the good visibility of the controls of the timer. Pausing/starting it every 15 seconds for 60 minutes was identified to be long and senseless to the users. They demonstrated that they could use the control directly after first use (which refers to ease of use criteria). Modifying this task to do it for 20 seconds total time with 2 pause/start every 10 seconds would have been enough to validate the criterias.</p>
            <h2>Provided Test Material (questionnaires, data collection sheet, etc.)</h2>
            <p>To report all of our observations, the Wakr group prepared a pre/post-test questionnaire along with a brief explanation of what to take note of during the tests. The questionnaires were relatively complete and were well received by the test users. A lot of questions required “long” answers while the sheet spacing did not allow it. However an issue that we encountered during the testing was that we were not provided with any sort of data collection sheet. In order to record any data or notes, we were forced to write the info on the included questionnaire sheet. This was problematic because we didn’t really have any sort of consistent data entry rubric to follow besides the basic time keeping of each task. It would have been more convenient for the testers to have been provided with a sheet that had a table where you could fill out the time required for each task. Perhaps even the pass/fail criteria could have been included on this sheet to give the testers a better idea of their expectations for the tests. Their testing procedure also did not make reference to getting an informed consent from the test subject for being filmed. The NavSense team took care to obtain verbal consent from each participant specifying that only their hands would be filmed and their voice would be recorded.</p>

            <h1>Design Critique</h1>

            <p>It was unfortunate that although we had a semi-working version of the Wakr mobile application, we did not have access to any wearable device. Even with our team member’s technical backgrounds we weren’t immediately able to understand what the purpose of the mobile application was. It would have helped if we had some sort of hardware platform to actually interface with the mobile platform. We found the only purpose served by the Wakr application was for it to be a basic stopwatch. The chosen personas had no relation to the actual functionality of the timer or anything else within the application. Regardless of what changes were made to the personas, the timer still acted the same way. It would help if the the persona details were included on the main page so that the user knows which persona they are currently using. Either the persona name should be included on the home page or the details of the persona should be clearly displayed. This would lead to an increased visibility of the current system state.</p>

            <p>One specific issue that was pointed out during the user testing was the fact that most people don’t know the HCI definition of the word “persona”. Although the user could easily figure out what it means by clicking on the button, it isn’t very representative of what the menu is actually used for. We found that it would be more appropriate for a general user if the menu was renamed to “Profiles”. This term is more commonly used in mobile applications when referring to pre-set or user customizable settings. The user would likely be more familiar to this word and therefore increase the ease of use of the system as well as the consistency with the other applications in general.</p>

            <p>Moreover, on the personas page there were two issues that was encountered during testing. The first issue was that the text inputted in the reminders field does not save. If a user wishes to input any sort of reminder, it won’t be there when they go to edit the persona for a second time. The second issue on this page was that there isn’t any sort of “back” button for the user to use. There is no option for the case where the user doesn’t want to save the changes made to their customized persona. Although you can use the built-in Android “back” button, it would be less confusing if there was one included within the application close to the “save” button. By adding such a button and grouping it with the “save” button, the visibility of the controls, ease of use and effectiveness of the system would be increase.  </p>

            <p>Aside from the personas page, there was also an issue with the User Manual not opening when clicking on the button as well as no feedback indicating to the user that he properly pressed it or not. One of the test subjects waited for the manual to open thinking it was loading while in reality it was just an empty button. This should be fixed so that the user is directed to the manual which would be the expected effect of pressing on such a button. </p>
