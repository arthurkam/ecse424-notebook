            <p>Emma just moved to Montreal from France to study at McGill University. She has been to Montreal once before but doesn’t know her way around at all. When she did previously visit Montreal, she really enjoyed the Notre-Dame Cathedral and the surrounding area. As with most people her age, she uses her cell phone frequently and is comfortable with the adaptation new technologies. She wants to familiarize herself with the city so that she can feel more comfortable living here alone. Instead of having to look at her phone while attempting to navigate unfamiliar streets, Emma wants a simpler way to orient herself in her new environment.</p>
            <p>Goals  - To be able to eventually feel comfortable navigating her new city by herself without having to constantly stare at her phone.</p>
            <p>Skills/Abilities - Social media master, tech savvy, tap dancing</p>

            <p>Although Taylor has lived in Montreal for his entire life, he can still appreciate being alone in the outdoors. At the end of his work week, Taylor typically heads up to Baie-Comeau to hike and camp for the weekend. When hiking in the deep woods,  he often finds himself walking in circles unable to locate certain landmarks. While Taylor doesn’t exceedingly use his cell phone throughout the day, he is quite comfortable with the technology nonetheless. Taylor would love a way to be able to easily locate his tent along with the occasional water source whenever he wants without getting lost or fumbling with his phone.</p>
            <p>Goals - Be able to confidently navigate the outdoors regardless of the unanticipated nature of his hikes.</p>
            <p>Skills/Abilities - hunting/fishing, tax returns</p>

            <p>Steven recently turned 14 and is looking forard to being one of the upper classmen in his school this year. Since his grades were good last year, his mom surprised him with a new smartphone for his birthday. Although he has trouble keeping it in his pocket, both of his parents agree that he should be more discrete with it when walking home alone. Steven occasionally walks through areas with older boys who would have no problem snatching up his phone. He also agrees that it would be nice to feel confident of his way back home without having to pull out his shiny new mobile device.</p>

            <h1><a id="Related_Products_0"></a>Related Products</h1>
            <p>Multiple products are currently available to address the navigational needs of the general public. These products cover a wide range of interaction modalities, functionalities and characteristics. The objective of this section is to provide an overview of the most widely used systems and navigational solutions at the time of this writing. Also note that this analysis is limited to commercially available systems. For a more synthesized overview of the advantages and limitations of each product, one can jump to the Product Comparison section.
            </p>
            <h2>Physical compass and map</h2>
            <p>It is important to note that the use of a compass and map remains one of the most reliable ways to navigate through any kind of terrain (i.e. city, forest, etc.). However, their use as a daily orientation/navigation aid for the identified personas is limited by the fact that their operation is not intuitive. Their proper operation relies on intensive training and frequent use. Moreover, the typical functionality of a compass/map requires the user to direct all of their attention to it and use both hands. Because of this, the user loses the majority of their situational awareness while using the system. If the user intends to travel to a new location, they must also purchase separate maps.</p>
            <p>Price :  &gt; 30 $ for an entry-level quality compass and local map + subsequent maps purchase</p>
            <h2><a id="Dedicated_handheld_GPS_8"></a>Dedicated handheld GPS</h2>
            <div class="thumbnail" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px">
              <img src="fig2.jpg"/>
              fig. 2.
            </div>
            <p>Handheld GPS are widely used in the outdoor domain. They provide a lot of information such as current latitude/longitude, heading, speed, trajectory, altitude, etc. Their interface is often composed of a few buttons and a black/grey LCD display such as the one displayed in fig. 2. This also presents one more item to carry/hold when our persona’s hands are already filled by the bags, a purse or the phone they are carrying.</p>
            <p>Limiting the analysis to the device pictured here, the input method composed of 8 buttons around hat is assumed to be a circular directional pad is far from intuitive.  There seems to be a certain pattern for how the functions map to the buttons. Menu related elements (Back, Menu and Enter) are at the right, zoom in and out at the top. However the left side is not as logical, starting with a quit button at the bottom (difference between quit and back?), followed by the red circle which is assumed to be a recording function (what is being recorded?) and then a “Mem” button which probably refers to saved trajectories or data. In terms of output to the user, this device is limited to visual feedback. This collection of information is not relevant for a casual user who solely wants to orient themselves with a glance, or without even looking at their device. Simply put, a user needs to carefully read the user manual in order to be able to appropriately use all of the device’s functions.</p>
            <p>Price : &gt; 100 $ for an entry-level knon brand device (Garmin, Magellan, etc.) + maps purchase</p>

            </div>
            <p>There are a lot of apps intended for navigation but this brief analysis is focused on Google maps turn-by-turn navigation. An image of the interface in use is visible in fig. 3. This application offers a lot of interesting features such as choice of transportation method and display type (3D navigation, street vie or satellite view). An obvious advantage of this approach is that it only requires a smartphone which a large portion of the population already owns. This application is assumed to be easy to use for someone already familiar with smartphones in general.</p>
            <p>The user interface is not too cluttered and offers basic direction indications with associated distances as well as an overview of the map/satellite view/street view. In addition to visual indications, one can activate voice-guided directions. This function is particularly attractive for the personas described above since it does not require them to handle the device once it has been set up. However, audio feedback can be masked in noisy environments if the user does not use headphones. The use of headphones can also lead to a reduced situational awareness.</p>
            <p>Price : Free (assuming the user already owns a smartphone)</p>
            <br>
            <h2><a id="wearables_20"></a>Wearables</h2>
            <p>Different wearable technologies exist to address navigation and orientation issues. Only three of these devices will be analyzed in this section. These devices were chosen in particular due to the different body locations where they are worn.</p>
            <h3><a id="North_Pa_22"></a>North Paw</h3>
            <div class="thumbnail" style="float: right;">
              <img src="fig4.jpg" style="width:300px"/>
              fig. 4.
            </div>
            <p>The first unique feature about North Paw is that is independent from any other systems such as a smartphone. It is an ankle bracelet containing an array of vibrating actuators distributed around the system. Its principle of operation is simple; it senses magnetic North and actuates the appropriate actuator around the bracelet to point to it just as a compass would.</p>
            <p>There is no human input necessary to operate it if you do not account for turning it on and potentially, calibration.  The user wears it around their ankle hidden under their pants making this system discrete. Furthermore since it does not require manual operation, the users are free to carry all of their belongings around freely. One should however be aware that knowing where magnetic North is may have a limited impact on daily navigation/orientation.</p>
            <p>Price : 150 $ for kit, 200 $ preassembled</p>
            <br>
            <h3><a id="Smartwatch_29"></a>Smartwatch</h3>
            <div class="thumbnail" style="float: right;margin-left:10px;">
              <img src="fig5.jpg" style="width:250px;"/>
              fig. 5.
            </div>
            <p>Different smartwatches offer various features but this analysis is limited to the low cost pebble. This devices requires a smartphone to use the Nav Me application. Once it is set up, the wearable device acts as a remote multimodal display to make google maps more convenient in terms of display capabilities. By using this combination, the personas do not need to manipulate their phones in order to receive the needed navigation information.</p>
            <p>In terms of input, when using the Nav Me application, the user only has to enter the desired destination into Google maps as he would be using his phone. However in the case of the smartwatch, the feedback experience is much richer. In fact, a new modality is added to the interface by using the smartwatch: vibration. By using this approach, the system avoids issues associated with the noisy commuter environment and makes the interaction much more personal. In this case, vibrations are used to indicate a new instruction to the user. This approach has a clear advantage of letting the personas keep their phones tucked in their pockets or purses while benefiting from the navigation instruction at a glance. However, this approach again raises the issue of situational awareness: the user still has to look at the device to read the instructions.</p>
            <p>Price : 99.99 $ (watch only, assuming the user owns a Bluetooth enabled smartphone)</p>
            <h3><a id="Smart_footear_35"></a>Smart footwear</h3>
            <div class="thumbnail" style="float: right; margin-left:10px">
              <img src="fig6.jpg" style="width:250px;"/>
              fig. 6.
            </div>
            <p>Although there are no quite a few available models of smart shoes and insoles on the market, this analysis is limited to the Lechal smart shoe (fig. 6). This device is different in comparison to the other wearables because it actually replaces that the user wears daily. It is important to note that in order to be used, this system requires the companion app to run on a smartphone.</p>
            <p>In terms of inputs, multiple options are available to the user and have to be turned on/off in the mobile application. There are options for voice commands, foot gestures commands as ell as the visual on-screen interface. In terms of outputs, these smart shoes have powerful vibration actuators located in the pod (grey block on the side). These electromechanical elements are used to transfer instructions to the user through different vibration patterns. Unique patterns are used to indicate whether the users should turn left or right.</p>
            <p>Price : 220 $ (pair of shoe and single basic pod, assuming the user ons a Bluetooth enabled smartphone)</p>

            <p>All of these related products present advantages in terms of interfaces to help the personas in their daily navigation/orientation. Hoever, some of the limitations presented above simply cannot be ignored when considering the needs and living habits of the personas.</p>
            <p>Along the same lines, our proposed approach takes root in the advantages of the smartphone and wearable solutions mainly because of personas’ living habits and budget. It is also hypothesized that in order to maximize the orientation efficiency, the system has to be beacon based instead of being “navigation instruction” based. This means that the user has the ability to set his desired reference points to known locations (fig 7., workplace (A), common public attraction (B), apartment (C), etc.). Another major difference between our solution and previously presented products is the way vibrations are used. ONLY when the user’s orientation is aligned with one of its selected beacons (A - McConnel engineering building on fig. 7), a signature vibration pattern associated to that element will be produced. In addition to providing the user with an orientation reference based on his selected points of interests, bird-flight distance between the user and the given beacon is to be modulated in the vibration signal to further inform him of his position.</p>

            <p>This section presents the overall architecture of the proposed system. Fig. 8 shows all of the software APIs and SDKs as well as a schematic representation of the architecture. Apart from the user, two main components are used, an android smartphone and the pebble smartwatch. Software APIs are provided by google for reading onboard sensors, obtaining map related information (position, etc.)</p>
            <p>It is assumed that any team would be able to pick up this schematic and develop the proposed system, assuming they have programming knowledge in Java (Android side) and C (Pebble Smartwatch).</p>

            <h1><a id="Feasibility_4"></a>Feasibility</h1>
            <p>With team members having multiple skills ranging from web design to hardware engineering there is no doubt that this system can be implemented in the allotted time frame.</p>
            <p>Multiple aspects have to be taken in account. The first one is hardare. The fact that all of the hardware is already available to the team (android smartphones and pebble smartwatch) eliminates risks associated with parts sourcing. On the software side, team members have extended experience with C programming language (for the pebble) and have already used Java to program simple android applications.</p>
            <p>A large portion of the development time will be associated to programming the Android device, especially the Google Maps features such as selecting the points of interest and calculating distance/orientation associated with it. However, the team has access to manufacturers APIs/SDKs and will be using basic functions extensively documented.</p>
