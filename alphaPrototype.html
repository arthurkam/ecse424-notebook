            </span></span><![endif]>This oversight was caused by the fact that the NavSense
            team assumed the users would already know that a Pebble Smartwatch is required
            when using the application. Since evidently this was not the case, a screen will
            be displayed that will let the user know that they must first pair the wearable
            device with their smartphone before proceeding. If the smartwatch is already
            paired with the smartphone, then the user will simply be brought to the map
            home screen. This modification increases the <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
            normal'>ease of use</b> of the system for people less comfortable with
          technologies by avoiding potential mistakes or misunderstanding. Therefore it
          also makes the system more <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>accessible</b>
          to the users with different technology skills.</p>

            </span></span><![endif]>The implementation of the vibration preview is a
            complicated task. Although we agree that it would be beneficial to the user to
            know exactly what the vibration pattern is beforehand, it would take up too
            much of our allotted time for this deliverable. The implementation of this
            feature is currently in progress. Due to the <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
            normal'>time required to implement (feasibility)</b> this feature, the NavSense
          team should have it completed by the Beta prototype deliverable.</p>

            </span></span><![endif]>The letter labeling system is used for its simplicity.
            By displaying complete labels associated to each point, the screen space would
            get cluttered. However, to try to address this issue, a complementary element
            was added to the tutorial to indicate that the user can see the full label name
            by clicking on the point. This way, the user is aware of the supported
            interaction method and how to access this information in the app. The user also
            has the possibility to see the points list where he will see the letter-label
            relation. Although the feedback from the evaluating teams refers to a truncated
            text, no NavSense team member experienced this effect on their device. These
            modifications directly increase <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>ease of
              use</b> of the system and reduce the number of operations required to obtain
            the expected results (<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>efficiency</b>). </p>

            </span></span><![endif]>The implementation of a search function in the NavSense
            application is complicated task. Although it would be beneficial for a user to
            be able to search for any location on the map, this would be a very <b
                                  style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>time consuming task (feasibility)</b>.
                                Instead the NavSense team decided to focus on smaller fixes that would yield a
                                greater increase in the final usability of the design. We hope to be able to
                                add this feature for the next deliverable. </p>

            appropriate button would be 'Done'. Changes have been made to reflect this
            which in turn increase the <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>learnability
              and ease of use </b>of the system. Now<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
            </span>a user can encounter the menu for the first time and immediately

            Firstly, the '+' sign is highlighted to indicate that it allows the user to add
            a pin on their desired location. They are also prompted to notice that they can
            move the map to precisely place a pin on their desired location. Lastly, the
            check mark is highlighted to indicate to the user that they need to validate
            their reference point placement. The addition of this tutorial has increased
            the <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>ease of use</b> of the system. Since
            the alpha prototype was to be tested in conjunction with the user manual/test
            plan we didn't think of adding a tutorial to the application. It makes sense
            however for this to have been included in the initial prototype. </p>

            </span></span><![endif]>In the current configuration, the NavSense application
            does not place the newest reference point at the top of the list. This could be
            problematic for users who do not know that you can scroll through the list of
            points. When a new reference point is added, a user might not notice it since
            it was initially placed at the bottom list(perhaps out of view from the user).
            When a user adds a new reference point, it would make sense that this point is
            the most likely to be edited immediately after placement. For this reason, new
            reference points are now placed at the top of the list so that they are more
            easily accessible. This modification directly affect the <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

            <p class=normal style='text-indent:36.0pt'>The current state of the NavSense
            system is at a point where we can say that we have met all of the initial goals
            set in the project proposal. We wanted to create a system using a wearable
            interface that allows users to orient and direct themselves in an unfamiliar
            environment. This work was inspired by the birds and turtles' abilities to use
            the magnetic field of the earth to navigate. The NavSense platform allows users
            to orient themselves in relation reference points that they set on a mobile
            application. Once their reference points are set on their NavSense app, a
            smartwatch allows them to 'feel' their orientation without the need to look at
            their mobile device.</p>
