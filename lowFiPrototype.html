						<h1>Design Concepts</h1>
						<p>
						For this project, our product composes of two different devices. The first one is the wearable device, which our team brainstormed on where would be a good location for the device to located. At the end, the clear winner is using it as a watch, as it is the most accessable and also least obstructive way of wearing the device.

						</div>
						</p>
						<p>
						The second device needed is a smartphone application that connects to the wearable device. Our team sketched out several rough ideas for the application UI.

						<h1>Prototypes</h1>
						<h2>Prototype #1</h2>
						<h3>Wearable Prototype</h3>
						<p>
						The entire functionality of the system relies on the use of vibration to communicate the reference points to the user. For this reason, it was necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of this modality to convey the desired message. Consequently, even during the design of the low-fidelity prototype, the need for an actuating device along with a way to control it was necessary.
						<br>
						Note that although this implementation relies on “high” level technology, no code was written by the NavSense team. The mobile application SenseProxy, was provided by Ph.D. candidate Jeffrey Blum and used after receiving his verbal approbation. This application lets the user send custom pattern composed of 3 distinct vibrations of varying amplitude and duration. The device used to render the vibration is a Pebble watch. The watchapp used in order to establish the communication between the Android device and the pebble is named SenseProxy and was acquired and used after receiving verbal approbation from its programmer.
						<br>
						During the tests, vibrations were manually sent by an observer by pressing the appropriate button on the mobile application user interface. The feedback was sent when the user was oriented in what the observer estimated to be the appropriate direction. It is important to note that a latency of about a second could be estimated between the time the user pressed the button and the feedback pattern being rendered to the user.

						Multiple low fidelity prototypes for the NavSense UI were tested. For the user observations, a paper version of the prototype was chosen to simulate the use of the mobile application. To make the paper UI pages feel more realistic, a 3D model of a holder was designed and printed to hold the snapshots. Since we now had a convenient holder for the UI pages, several important design decisions were able to be tested.  During the testing, the user would load the 3D printed holder with all of the UI pages and slide them in/out in order depending on what feature of the application they want to access. 
						<br>
						<br>
						The initial page of the application shows a splash screen which the user can slide upwards to reveal a map. This would simulate the main screen that the user interacts with during the majority of the application use. The intended functionality of this screen is for the user to tap anywhere on the map to add a new reference point. It is meant to be intuitive and similar to other common mobile gps applications.
						<br>
						<br>
						Once a new reference point is added, the user would be brought to a screen that allows them to add a custom name to their location as well as a vibration pattern. The initial paper UI that was designed included a “tap to record” type of vibration customization. This was soon changed to a collection of pre-set patterns after discussion within the NavSense group as well as the test users.
						<br>
						<div class="center">
							<img src="corey_prototype7.jpg">
							<img src="lowfi_tut.jpg">
						</div>
						<br>
						On a separate page, the user is presented with all of their currently saved reference points. Here they have the option to edit or delete any of these references to make room for new ones. They are also given the option to view any of their “remembered locations” that they saved while using a button on the smartwatch interface. These remembered locations are not saved as reference points but rather points of interest to later be reviewed by the user.

						<div class="center">
							<img src="corey_prototype8.1.jpeg">
							<img src="corey_prototype8.2.jpg">
						</div>
						If a user tries to add a new reference point but they already have too many, a notification will appear and allow them to quickly replace one of their old references with the new one that they are trying to add. 
						<div class="center">
							<img src="corey_prototype8.3.jpeg">
						</div>
						After testing this prototype with users and NavSense team members, multiple changes were decided upon that would improve the usability of the design. These changes include slight modifications to the “new reference point” page and perhaps a consolidation of the location Menu into the main map screen. 
						<br>
						Although the UI for the Pebble smartwatch application was thoroughly discussed, it will mainly be used to display very minimal information to the user. Since the display size is very small, it isn’t worth trying to clutter the screen. Very basic UI pages were tested such as the ones in the photos below. One screen shows the “No GPS signal”, one shows the direction of a reference point called “Home” and the third one shows the visual feedback associated with pressing the “remember location” button on the watch.

At no point the users detected vibration when there was none. The vibration pattern that was missed was due to an error from the “wizard of oz” responsible from delivering the vibration using the mobile interface. This task also proves the effectiveness of the system in delivering vibration based orientation information to the user. Since it was low fidelity prototyping, users pointed out that the latency between them being in the right orientation and actually receiving the signal was a nuisance. A key point also identified is that the feedback patterns should be pre-set and the user should choose amongst the most easily differentiable ones to HIM/HER. The option to register a tapping pattern will probably be discarded because it proved to be confusing to the user. In summary, simpler is better.</span></p>

						<p class="c7"><span class="c10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Conclusions :</b> </span><span>Since it was low-fidelity prototyping, the two patterns available were either 2 long pulses (1 s vibration, 300 ms break, 1 s vibration) or 3 long pulses (1 s vibration, 300 ms break, 1 s vibration, 300 ms break, 1 s vibration). Consequently, the difference between these two was quite easy to feel for the users. In this task, the users were able to properly locate a point not entered in their reference points by first obtaining their approximate orientation and location from their two known reference points. The error was higher than in task b but it may be due to observers estimation. A key factor in this task, as pointed out by users, is to make sure the different patterns are easily differentiable. Users indicated that since the patterns was not completely chosen by them, the association was harder to memorize. One of them admitted that after few more minutes of use, it would have become easier. &nbsp;In this order of idea, for the next iteration, care should be taken to ensure every proposed pattern is unique. </span></p>
